Wild Chicken University is a website that is built by a team of 5 during HackDuke 2018. Its main purpose is to gather university-level courses for students who are interested in self-studying. We did this by using HTML/CSS for the frontend and nodejs for the backend. The course information was retrieved through webscraping with python.
